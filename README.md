# Riefenheim 0.1 alpha
A tabletop RPG-app that creates rich detail for overland travel

Overland travel is often glossed over in tabletop RPGs, D&D in particular, because it lacks the structure and detail found in dungeons. 

This app is intended to prevent that by providing all the information a Game Master needs to make each day in the wilderness unique and
interesting with a single button click. 

It generates the following data:
- Encounters
- Weather
- Date
- Hours of sunlight in the day
- Moon phase


Features on the way:
- An actual user interface
- Showing 24 hours of weather instead of 8
- Weather lore

Potential features:
- Dynamic encounter tables based on tribal strength
- Name generation for humanoid creatures
- Map interface and distance calculation
